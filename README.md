# FusionAuth with Elastic Search support

FusionAuth solves Authentication, authorization, and user management for developers. Check their website here https://fusionauth.io

This docker compose file uses these containers:
- FusionAuth v1.21.0 uthentication, authorization, and user management server https://hub.docker.com/u/fusionauth
- ElasticSearch v7.9.3 for improved user search support on FusionAuth https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch
- Caddy v2.2.1 as reverse proxy server https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy

## Environment Variables

To deploy, create an ```.env``` file in the same directory with ```docker-compose.yml``` file at server with your environment variables in it.

```
POSTGRES_SERVER=your-postgres-db-server-ip
POSTGRES_SERVER_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-secure-db-password

DATABASE_USERNAME=fusionauth
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-secure-fusionauth-db-password

ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms512m -Xmx512m

FUSIONAUTH_APP_MEMORY=512M
FUSIONAUTH_APP_RUNTIME_MODE=development

CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS=:80
```

## Caddy Config

Caddy config is named ```Caddyfile``` and it is pretty straightforward.

**Default configuration is**
```
{$CADDY_SITE_ADDRESS} {
  reverse_proxy fusionauth:9011
}
```
which publishes FusionAuth web interface on the server's port 80 which is defined in ```.env``` file above.

Replace ```:80``` with your domain name to get automatic https via LetsEncrypt. Add your domain to serve only https (recommended)

Don't forget to set your DNS first as Caddy automatically validates and creates certificates for you as soon as it started.

Allow 443/tcp port to outside access before rebuilding your docker-compose. This might be tricky as docker modifies iptables on linux directly https://docs.docker.com/network/iptables/

If you don't want to open your web interface to the public, you could always create a tunnel for it

```
# sudo ssh -N -L 443:127.0.0.1:443 root@server-public-ip -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

and visit https://127.0.0.1 after your docker containers up.

## Some Docker commands

```
// Spin up the containers
# docker-compose up -d

// List active containers
# docker ps

// See the logs
# docker logs your_container_name

// Restart all in the compose file
# docker-compose restart

// Restart an individual container
# docker restart your_container_name
```
